HOW TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL INSTALLER
P&ID Standardization Application
========================================

We've included an installer script that will create a professional setup.exe
like Visual Studio Code, AutoCAD, or any commercial application.

========================================
METHOD 1: USING INNO SETUP (RECOMMENDED)
========================================

WHAT IS INNO SETUP?
-------------------
Inno Setup is a free, professional installer creation tool used by thousands
of applications including popular software like 7-Zip and many others.

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD INNO SETUP
---------------------------
1. Go to: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
2. Download "Inno Setup 6.x" (latest version)
3. Install it on your computer (it's free!)

STEP 2: CREATE THE INSTALLER
----------------------------
1. Open Inno Setup Compiler
2. Click File → Open
3. Browse to: PIDStandardization_Installer.iss
4. Click Build → Compile (or press F9)
5. Wait for compilation to complete (takes about 30 seconds)

STEP 3: GET YOUR INSTALLER
--------------------------
The installer will be created in:
  Deployment_Package\Installer_Output\PIDStandardization_Setup_v1.0.0.exe

This is the file you distribute to your team!

FILE SIZE:
- The setup.exe will be about 170-180 MB (includes everything)
- Self-extracting, professional installer
- Includes uninstaller automatically


========================================
WHAT THE INSTALLER DOES
========================================

PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION EXPERIENCE:
- Welcome screen with application description
- License agreement (if you add one)
- Choose installation directory
- Select components to install
- Create desktop shortcut (optional)
- Configure AutoCAD auto-load (optional)
- Progress bar during installation
- Launch application after install (optional)

INSTALLED FILES:
- Main application: C:\Program Files\PIDStandardization\
- AutoCAD plugin: C:\Program Files\PIDStandardization\AutoCAD_Plugin\
- Documentation and guides
- Start Menu shortcuts
- Desktop shortcut (if selected)
- AutoCAD auto-load configuration (if selected)

UNINSTALLER:
- Professional uninstaller in Control Panel
- Removes all files and registry entries
- Option to keep user data or remove it


========================================
DISTRIBUTING TO YOUR TEAM
========================================

BEFORE CREATING THE INSTALLER:
1. Make sure all files in Deployment_Package are up-to-date
2. Test the application on your computer
3. Update version number in PIDStandardization_Installer.iss if needed

TO DISTRIBUTE:
1. Share the setup.exe file (from Installer_Output folder)
2. Team members just double-click the setup.exe
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Done! Application installed like any professional software

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TEAM:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Administrator rights (to install to Program Files)
- SQL Server 2022 Express (should already be installed)
- AutoCAD 2026 (for plugin features, optional)
- About 200 MB free disk space


========================================
METHOD 2: USING INSTALL.BAT (ALTERNATIVE)
========================================

If you don't want to install Inno Setup, you can still use the INSTALL.bat
script we created earlier:

1. Right-click INSTALL.bat → Run as administrator
2. Files are copied to C:\Program Files\PIDStandardization\
3. AutoCAD is configured
4. Desktop shortcut is created

NOTE: This method doesn't create a professional installer file, but it works
for quick deployment on individual computers.


========================================
METHOD 3: MANUAL COPY (SIMPLEST)
========================================

For testing or individual installations:

1. Copy the Deployment_Package folder to team members
2. They run INSTALL.bat as administrator
   OR
3. They manually copy PIDStandardization.UI.exe anywhere and run it
4. They manually load the AutoCAD plugin using NETLOAD


========================================
CUSTOMIZING THE INSTALLER
========================================

You can edit PIDStandardization_Installer.iss to customize:

LINE 6-8: Change application name, version, publisher
LINE 28: Change default installation directory
LINE 65-66: Add your company logo icons
LINE 94-99: Customize Start Menu shortcuts
LINE 145-165: Modify AutoCAD configuration logic

After making changes, recompile with Inno Setup.


========================================
ADVANCED: CODE SIGNING (OPTIONAL)
========================================

For enterprise deployment, you may want to digitally sign the installer
to avoid Windows SmartScreen warnings:

1. Obtain a code signing certificate from a Certificate Authority
2. Use SignTool.exe to sign the setup.exe
3. Alternatively, configure Inno Setup to sign during compilation

This is optional but recommended for professional deployment.


========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

PROBLEM: "Access denied" during installation
SOLUTION: Right-click setup.exe → Run as administrator

PROBLEM: Windows SmartScreen blocks the installer
SOLUTION: Click "More info" → "Run anyway" (or use code signing)

PROBLEM: Compilation fails in Inno Setup
SOLUTION: Check that all files referenced in .iss exist in Deployment_Package

PROBLEM: Installer created but application won't run
SOLUTION: Test PIDStandardization.UI.exe directly first to verify it works


========================================
RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
========================================

FOR FIRST DISTRIBUTION:
1. Download and install Inno Setup (one-time, 5 minutes)
2. Open PIDStandardization_Installer.iss in Inno Setup
3. Click Compile (F9)
4. Share the generated setup.exe with your team
5. Done!

FOR FUTURE UPDATES:
1. Update the application files in Deployment_Package
2. Change version number in PIDStandardization_Installer.iss (line 7)
3. Recompile in Inno Setup
4. Distribute new setup.exe to team

DURATION:
- First time: 10-15 minutes (including Inno Setup installation)
- Subsequent times: 1-2 minutes (just recompile)
